- Source of truth: `GHUMNE_MASTER_SPEC.md`.

## TASK-001 — Complete

**Understand:** Read the entire specification and inspect all existing project files and applicable instructions.

**Plan:** Inventory every requested subsystem, identify reusable work, and document the sequential foundation plan before coding.

**Implement:** Created `REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and this progress log. Updated TASK-001 status in the master specification. The original workspace contains only the specification; there is no application code or asset to reuse.

**Test:** Full file enumeration and local tool checks completed. Type checking, linting, builds, and application tests are unavailable at this baseline because there is no manifest or application. No runtime test is claimed as passed.

**Review:** No working functionality, secrets, data, or assets were changed. Initializing the missing application follows the specified architecture (DEC-007).

**Document:** Audit includes all requested areas, missing requirements, reuse findings, and the plan for TASK-002 through TASK-007.

**Files created:** `REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`.

**Files modified:** `GHUMNE_MASTER_SPEC.md` (task status only).

**Environment/migrations:** No environment or database changes. Local Git initialization is needed for the specified commit workflow.

**Known issues/follow-up:** No existing test infrastructure. Supabase credentials and verified travel data will be needed at their respective tasks.
